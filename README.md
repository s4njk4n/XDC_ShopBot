## What is XDC_ShopBot?

XDC_ShopBot is a simple, beginner-friendly Telegram bot that lets you sell digital products (like access codes, files, or services) and accept payments in XDC cryptocurrency. It's designed for anyone who wants to set up an online shop without needing advanced coding skills. 

The bot handles:
- Showing a list of your products to customers.
- Guiding customers through purchase (including privacy policy acceptance and country checks if needed).
- Generating unique payment amounts in XDC (or converted from USD).
- Monitoring the XDC blockchain for payments.
- Automatically delivering a success message (e.g., an access code or digital product download links) to the customer after payment.

Everything runs on your own server (like a cheap VPS), and you control it all. No third-party services required beyond Telegram and a free XDC RPC endpoint.

This repo makes it ultra-simple: Clone it, run a setup script, and you're ready to sell!

## Who is this for?
- Small business owners, creators, or hobbyists who want to accept XDC payments.
- People with basic computer skills â€“ we'll guide you step-by-step.
- No coding needed after setup; manage products via Telegram commands.

## Features
- **Easy Setup:** A script asks for your details and configures everything.
- **Product Management:** Add/remove products and set delivery messages right from Telegram (only you, the owner, can do this).
- **Payments:** Customers pay exact amounts to your XDC wallet; bot auto-detects and delivers.
- **USD Support:** Price items in USD; bot converts to XDC using real-time rates.
- **Privacy & Restrictions:** Customizable privacy policy and excluded countries.
- **Logging:** Keeps records of sales for your records (e.g., taxes).
- **Secure:** Runs on your server; no sharing sensitive data.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you'll need:
1. A **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: Rent a cheap Linux server (e.g., from DigitalOcean, Vultr, or Linode for ~$5/month). It needs Ubuntu or Debian (most common). Make sure you can SSH into it.
2. **Telegram Account:** For creating the bot and managing it.
3. **XDC Wallet Address:** Get one from a wallet like XDCPay or MetaMask (set to XDC network). It starts with "xdc...".
4. **Basic Command-Line Knowledge:** We'll provide exact commands to copy-paste.

If you're new to VPS:
- Sign up for a provider.
- Create a server (choose Ubuntu 22.04 or similar).
- SSH in: On Windows, use PuTTY; on Mac/Linux, use terminal with `ssh user@ip-address`.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
On your VPS, open the terminal (via SSH) and run these commands to install Git and clone the repo.

```bash
# Update your system and install Git (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/s4njk4n/XDC_ShopBot.git
cd XDC_ShopBot
```

This downloads all the files to a folder called `XDC_ShopBot`.

### Step 2: Create a Telegram Bot
You need a Telegram bot token. This is like a password for your bot.

1. Open Telegram on your phone or desktop.
2. Search for `@BotFather` (official Telegram bot creator).
3. Start a chat and type `/newbot`.
4. Follow prompts: Give your bot a name (e.g., "MyXDCSHopBot") and username (ends with "bot", e.g., "my_xdc_shop_bot").
5. BotFather will give you a **token** like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`. Copy it safely.

### Step 3: Get Your Telegram User ID
This is your personal ID, so only you can manage the bot.

1. In Telegram, search for `@userinfobot`.
2. Start a chat and send `/start`.
3. It will reply with your User ID (a number like `123456789`). Copy it.

### Step 4: Run the Setup Script
Back in your VPS terminal (inside the `XDC_ShopBot` folder):

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run it
./setup.sh
```

The script will ask questions:
- Telegram Bot Token: Paste the one from BotFather.
- Seller XDC Address: Your wallet address (starts with "xdc").
- Your Telegram User ID: The number from @userinfobot.
- Excluded Countries: Enter comma-separated like "US,CA,RU" or leave blank.
- Welcome Title: e.g., "Welcome to My XDC Shop!" (optional, press Enter for default).
- Privacy Policy: Custom text (optional, press Enter for default).

It will create config files, example products, and directories. Setup complete!

## Starting the Bot
To run the bot:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts two background processes: the bot (handles Telegram messages) and the monitor (checks for payments on XDC blockchain).

To stop:

```bash
./stop.sh
```

To reset logs/states (if something goes wrong):

```bash
./reset.sh
```

## Usage

### For Customers
1. They start chatting with your bot on Telegram (share the bot username).
2. Type `/start`.
3. Accept privacy policy.
4. If excluded countries set, confirm they're not from there.
5. See product list.
6. Reply with product ID to buy.
7. Send exact XDC amount to your address (bot gives instructions).
8. After payment, bot sends success message (e.g., access code or digital product download links).

### For You (Admin/Owner)
Chat with your bot on Telegram. Only your User ID can use these commands:

- `/additem`: Add a new product (follow prompts for ID, name, price, currency, message basename).
- `/delitem <ID>`: Delete a product (e.g., `/delitem 1`).
- `/setmessage`: Set/update a success message for a product (prompts for basename and text).
- `/listitems`: Show current products.
- `/setwelcometitle`: Change the welcome message title.
- `/setpolicy`: Update the privacy policy text.
- `/setexcluded`: Change excluded countries.

Example: Adding an item guides you step-by-step in chat.

Products are stored in `items.csv` (but edit via commands to avoid mistakes). Success messages in `messages/` folder as `.txt` files.

Sales logged in `success_log.csv` for your records.

## Troubleshooting
- Bot not responding? Check `bot_output.log` and `monitor_output.log` for errors.
- Payment not detecting? Ensure your RPC_URL in `config.sh` works (default is public).
- Need to change config? Edit `config.sh` manually or re-run `setup.sh`.
- Questions? Open an issue on GitHub.

## Security Notes
- Keep your bot token and address private.
- Run on a secure VPS with firewall (e.g., `ufw allow ssh; ufw enable`).
- Bot uses flock for concurrency, but for high traffic, consider upgrades.
